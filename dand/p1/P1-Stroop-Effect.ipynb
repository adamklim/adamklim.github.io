    "In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participant’s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example <font color ='red'>RED</font>, <font color ='blue'>BLUE</font>. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example <font color ='green'>PURPLE</font>, <font color ='purple'>ORANGE</font>. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.\n",
