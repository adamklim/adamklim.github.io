# FEND_PROJECT_Neighborhood_Map

_work in progress_

AS a part of another Nanodegree program (Data Analyst Nanodegree), I completed OpenStreet Map project, where I selected Auckland, New Zealand as an area of choice. I selected Auckland because it's one of the most distant cities from Vienna, Austria, where I live. To be consistent, I will build the Neighborhood Map of Auckland.
